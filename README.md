<b>Introduction</b><br>
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Dannyâ€™s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

<b>Case Study Questions</b> <br>
Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement:

<b>1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?</b><br>


    SELECT s.customer_id, SUM(m.price) AS total_spent
    FROM dannys_diner.sales s
    INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu m
    ON s.product_id=m.product_id
    GROUP BY s.customer_id
    ORDER BY s.customer_id;

| customer_id | total_spent |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |


<b>2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?</b><br>


    SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS days_visited
    FROM dannys_diner.sales s
    GROUP BY customer_id;

| customer_id | days_visited |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A           | 4            |
| B           | 6            |
| C           | 2            |

<b>3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?</b><br>


    WITH ranked AS(
    SELECT s.customer_id, s.product_id, m.product_name, s.order_date,
    	   DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY order_date) 
    FROM dannys_diner.sales s
    LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu m
    ON s.product_id=m.product_id
    ORDER BY s.order_date, s.customer_id)
    SELECT customer_id, product_name
    FROM ranked
    WHERE dense_rank=1
    GROUP BY customer_id, product_name;

| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A           | curry        |
| A           | sushi        |
| B           | curry        |
| C           | ramen        |


<b>4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?</b><br>


    SELECT m.product_name AS most_purchased_item, COUNT(s.product_id) AS times_purchased
    FROM dannys_diner.sales s
    INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu m
    ON s.product_id=m.product_id
    GROUP BY most_purchased_item
    ORDER BY times_purchased DESC
    LIMIT 1;

| most_purchased_item | times_purchased |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| ramen               | 8               |


<b>5. Which item was the most popular for each customer? </b?<br>


    WITH ranked AS(
    SELECT s.customer_id, m.product_name, COUNT(s.product_id) AS times_purchased,
    	   DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY COUNT(s.product_id) DESC)
    FROM dannys_diner.sales s
    INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu m
    ON s.product_id=m.product_id
    GROUP BY s.customer_id,m.product_name
    ORDER BY s.customer_id)
    SELECT customer_id, product_name, times_purchased
    FROM ranked
    WHERE dense_rank=1;

| customer_id | product_name | times_purchased |
| ----------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| A           | ramen        | 3               |
| B           | ramen        | 2               |

 <b>6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?</b><br>

    
    WITH ranked_orders AS(
    SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date,
    	DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date) AS ranked_order,
    	s.product_id,menu.product_name, m.join_date
    FROM dannys_diner.sales s
    INNER JOIN dannys_diner.members m
    ON s.customer_id=m.customer_id
    INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu menu
    ON s.product_id=menu.product_id
    WHERE s.order_date>=m.join_date
    ORDER BY s.customer_id
    )
    SELECT customer_id, product_name
    FROM ranked_orders
    WHERE ranked_order=1;

| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A           | curry        |
| B           | sushi        |

 
 <b>7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member? </b><br>


    WITH ranked_orders AS(
    SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date,
    	DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date DESC) AS ranked_order,
    	s.product_id,menu.product_name, m.join_date
    FROM dannys_diner.sales s
    INNER JOIN dannys_diner.members m
    ON s.customer_id=m.customer_id
    INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu menu
    ON s.product_id=menu.product_id
    WHERE s.order_date<m.join_date
    ORDER BY s.customer_id
    )
    SELECT customer_id, product_name
    FROM ranked_orders
    WHERE ranked_order=1;

| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A           | sushi        |
| A           | curry        |
| B           | sushi        |


What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
